The R script executes the data cleaning on the data which was already downloaded as follows:

1. Assigning variables 
features <- features.txt 
activities <- activity_labels.txt 
sub_test <- test/subject_test.txt 
x_test <- test/X_test.txt 
y_test <- test/y_test.txt 
sub_train <- test/subject_train.txt 
x_train <- test/X_train.txt 
y_train <- test/y_train.txt 

2. Merge the test subjects,training and test data using the cbind ()

3. Extracting the data from merged data in step2 based on the two parameters of mean and standard deviation using the pipe operator to tidy_data variable .

4. The second column of the tidy_data is replaced by the activities taken from the text file provided

5. All the new variables are assigned to the the tidy_data

6. The final data is extracted to the text file.
